# Slack OAuth helper

Certain Slack APIs (e.g. file upload) require an annoying OAuth token to access, and setting that up for yourself can be a pain in the ass. However, these tokens don't automatically expire so you can just generate these however you wish and then just use them.

This is an attempt to make this process less painful. You can alternatively follow Slack's own guide on how to create a "Add to Slack" -button at https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button.
